## Overview ##
The Hub Artifactory solution consists of two Artifactory plugins, blackDuckScanForHub and blackDuckCacheInspector.

The scanner pluginType, blackDuckScanForHub, can be configured to routinely scan your artifacts for open source vulnerabilities via the Black Duck Signature Scanner.

The inspector pluginType, blackDuckCacheInspector, can be configured to inspect your Artifactory remote repository caches for open source components and populate Black Duck vulnerability and policy metadata on them.
